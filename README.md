# HR-analytics-dashboard-with-QA-Testing

In this project we create a HR analytics dashboard for employee attrition using POWERBI and perform QA Testing using SQL.

The interactive dashboard keep track of 5 KPIs such as Employee Count, Attrition Count, Attrition Rate, Active Employees and Average Age.
Under QA Testing first we perform Functional validation to check whether different fields get updated as we apply our filters and data validation to check whether the data displayed after the filter is applied is in fact correct or not.
